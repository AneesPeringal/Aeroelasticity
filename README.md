# Aeroelasticity
This is the repository for the aeroselasticity project. 
The project analyses the effect of a nonlinear vibration absorber in the case of aeroelastic flutter of an airfoil.


# Methodology
- Derive the equations of motion (done with the derivations, Some terms additional)
- Simulation on matlab
- Visualize the data
- Tuning the absorber using optimization.
  
 # Publishing paper
 - Change the absorber type
 - Write the paper (References)
 -
